# FileCutter
Library to split a large file into small ones, and join them again into the original large file

> This library is based [in other code [**FileUtilities**]](https://github.com/J0rgeSerran0/FileUtilities) that I wrote some years ago
The motivation to do this, is to resolve an issue found in the original code and do the library simpler
